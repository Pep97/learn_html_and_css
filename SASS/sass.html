        Sass has to be complied into CSS so you have to use gulpjs and nodejs.
        <br><br>
        You'll use gulpjs to compile your sass into css and nodejs to install gulpjs.    
        <br><br>
        extantion: live sass compiler -> watch sass -> compile sass -> css  (by default it will use gulpjs)  
        <br><br>
        this is the command to run to activate gulpjs -> npm install gulp gulp-sass sass -save-dev

        gulp is the task runner, gulp-sass is the plugin that will compile sass and sass is the compiler that the gulp-sass plugin will use. And --save-dev means that our packages will be stored into out package.json

    SASS (Syntactically Awesome Stylesheets) is a CSS preprocessor that provides features not available in plain CSS. Here are some key features that SASS offers:
    <br>
    Variables: SASS allows you to define variables that can be reused throughout your stylesheet.
    <br>
    Nesting: SASS lets you nest your CSS selectors in a way that follows the same visual hierarchy of your HTML.
    <br>
    Mixins: These are like functions for CSS. You can define a mixin once and then reuse it throughout your stylesheet, even passing in different arguments each time.
    <br>
    Inheritance (Extend/Inherit): SASS provides a way to share a set of CSS properties from one selector to another.
    <br>
    Operators: SASS supports standard math operators like +, -, *, /, and %.
    <br>
    Control Directives: SASS provides control directives for libraries, such as @if, @for, @each, and @while.
    <br>
    Importing: SASS provides a more powerful @import that helps you to split your CSS into smaller, more maintainable portions.
    <br>
    Functions: SASS provides many built-in functions for manipulating colors and other values.
    <br>
    Partials and Modules: You can create partial SASS files that contain little snippets of CSS that you can include in other SASS files.
    <br>
    These features make SASS a powerful tool for writing more maintainable, scalable, and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) CSS.
